Your mission is to explore the system, learn about computer architecture, and locate all the viruses hiding in different components.\n\nBasic commands:\n-go : followed by a direction (n, s, e, w, up, down)\n-take : pick up an item\n-look : examine your surroundings or a specific item\n-read : read text content of items\n-scan : use on areas to detect virus presence\n-quarantine : use on viruses once found\n\nThe system has multiple levels, from the CPU to storage to networking. Each area represents a real computer architecture component with its own function. Learn about them as you explore!",
