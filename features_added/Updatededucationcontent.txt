        "cpu": """CPU (Central Processing Unit):
Modern CPUs integrate multiple cores and memory controllers onto a single package.
Each core contains:
- Control Unit: Coordinates operations and decodes instructions
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): Performs calculations and logical operations
- Registers: Ultra-fast storage for immediate data access
- L1 Cache: Smallest, fastest cache directly accessible by the core

Modern CPUs feature a cache hierarchy:
- L1 Cache: Per-core, fastest but smallest (tens of KB)
- L2 Cache: Usually per-core, larger but slower than L1
- L3 Cache: Shared among all cores, larger but slower than L2

The memory controller is now integrated into the CPU package rather than existing
as a separate northbridge component.""",

        # Update PCH description
        "pch": """Platform Controller Hub (PCH):
The PCH replaces the traditional northbridge/southbridge architecture of older systems.
It handles:
- Storage controllers for SATA and NVMe devices
- PCIe lanes for expansion devices
- USB controllers
- Network interfaces
- Connection to the BIOS/UEFI firmware

The PCH connects to the CPU via a high-speed DMI (Direct Media Interface) or QPI
(QuickPath Interconnect) link rather than the older front-side bus architecture.""",
