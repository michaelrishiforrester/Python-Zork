## Overview

KodeKloud Computer Quest is an interactive text adventure where players navigate through a computer system, learning about various hardware components while searching for and neutralizing viruses. The game simulates the internals of a modern computer, from the CPU cores to memory, storage, and peripherals.

## Features

- Detailed simulation of computer architecture components
- Exploration-based learning of computer hardware concepts
- Virus hunting gameplay that teaches security concepts
- Progressive knowledge system that tracks player learning
- Mini-games that demonstrate CPU pipelines and memory hierarchies
- Save/load system to preserve progress
- Enhanced UI with improved visuals and readability
- Web-based terminal interface for running the game in a browser

## Web Interface Setup

The game now includes a web interface using TypeScript, React, ReactFlow, and Vite, allowing you to play the game directly in a browser.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kodekloud-computer-quest.git
cd kodekloud-computer-quest

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flask flask-socketio flask-cors

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Web Interface

The web interface requires both a backend server and a frontend development server:

```bash
# Start the backend server (in one terminal)
npm run api

# Start the frontend development server (in another terminal)
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to http://localhost:5173 to play the game.

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the frontend
npm run build

# Serve the built files
npm run serve
```

## Terminal-Only Mode

You can still run the game directly in a terminal without the web interface:

```bash
# Run the game in terminal mode
python main.py
```

## Game Commands

The game supports a wide range of commands, including:

- Movement: `north` (n), `south` (s), `east` (e), `west` (w), etc.
- Exploration: `look` (l), `map` (m), `motherboard` (mb)
- Inventory: `inventory` (i), `take` (t), `drop` (d)
- Security: `scan` (s), `analyze` (a), `quarantine` (q)
- Information: `help` (h), `about`, `knowledge` (k)
- Educational: `visualize` (v), `simulate` (sim)

Type `help` in-game for a complete list of commands.

## Project Structure

The project now includes both the original Python game and a web interface:

```

## Web Interface Architecture

The web interface consists of:

1. **Backend**:
   - Flask server with Socket.IO for real-time communication
   - Runs the Python game in a PTY (pseudo-terminal)
   - Streams game output to the frontend
   - Processes user input and sends it to the game

2. **Frontend**:
   - React application with TypeScript
   - xterm.js for terminal emulation
   - ReactFlow for the interactive map visualization
   - Socket.IO client for communication with the backend
