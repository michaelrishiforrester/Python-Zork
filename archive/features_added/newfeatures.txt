Here are several recommendations focusing on the terminal interface:
Improve Directional Information

Use ASCII Directional Compass:

Copy      N
    NW NE
   W  +  E
    SW SE
      S
With arrows showing available paths (→ ↑ ↓ ←) and blockers (█) for unavailable directions.

Color-Code Directions:


Available directions: Green
Current location: Yellow/highlighted
Special connections: Cyan/blue

Enhance Structure & Readability

Better Section Separation:

Copy┏━━━━━━━━━━━ LOCATION ━━━━━━━━━━━┓
  CPU Package
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Description:

┏━━━━━━━ AVAILABLE CONNECTIONS ━━━━━━┓
  [N]orth: Core 1  [NE]: Core 2
  [S]outh: L3 Cache  [D]own: PCH
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Aligned Components List:

Copy┏━━━━━━━━ COMPONENTS ━━━━━━━━┓
  • instruction_manual
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

Add Breadcrumb/Path Display:

CopyLocation: CPU Package → Core 1 → Control Unit
Interface Enhancements

Add Compact Legend:

CopyShortcuts: [N]orth [S]outh [E]ast [W]est [NE] [SE] [SW] [NW] [U]p [D]own

CopyHealth: ██████████ | Items: 2/8 | Viruses: 1/5 Found, 0/5 Quarantined

Implement Command History:
Allow using the up/down arrow keys to recall previous commands.

Additional Suggestions

Tab Completion: Implement tab completion for commands and nearby items/directions.
Help Overlay: Add a quick help overlay accessible with '?'.
Progress Visualization: Add a small map or progress indicator showing explored areas.
Commands as Shortcuts: Allow one-letter shortcuts (n, s, e, w, i, l) for common commands.
Command Preprocessing: Handle common typos and normalize input.
